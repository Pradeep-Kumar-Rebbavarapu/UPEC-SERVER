## About the Project

This project is a standalone application that can be integrated to trumio's platform that will drive greater alumini engagement, upskill students on the latest technologies and ensure that students dilever projects that meet the clients expectation.
1. The Community Feed section serves as a dynamic catalyst within the engagement platform, strategically designed to enhance alumni engagement and streamline the inflow of client projects to students and universities.
2. Students will get project recommendations based on their skills and interests.
3. Clients can generate a product requirement document by just filling in the description of the project and the tech stacks required. This will be automatically generated by our AI model as and when the client clicks ont the PRD generate button. The PRD will include the project overview, original requirements, project goals, user stories, system architecture, tech stacks, requirement pool, ui/ux design, development methodology, security measures, testing strategy, scalability and performance, deployment plan, maintenance and support, risks and mitigations, compliance and regulations, budget and resources, timeline and milestones, communication plan and anything unclear. This will save a lot of time for the client and will drive greater engagement. 
4. Students upon accepting a project can automatically generate a project workflow that will help them plan their project. The AI tool will also help them divide task among the team members based on their skills and interests. This will compensate the need of a project manager and will help the students to deliver projects that meet the client's expectations.
5. Students can leverage the AI tool to generate the learning resources needed for a particular project and also on a personal level. This will help them to upskill themselves and will help the students in their overall growth and development in the platform.
6. There is a Trumio Copilot that will help the students and clients to get real time support and will help them to resolve their queries be it project related or general queries. This will help both the students and clients to get real time support and will help them to resolve their queries in a timely manner, driving greater engagement.
7. The platform has also included a rating based feature to gamify the complete process. This will make the students more competitive and will help them to deliver projects that meet the client's expectations. This will also help the clients to get the best out of the students and will help them to get projects that meet their expectations.
